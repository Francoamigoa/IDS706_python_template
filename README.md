[![Python Template for IDS706](https://github.com/Francoamigoa/IDS706_python_template/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Francoamigoa/IDS706_python_template/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This repository contains my **first Python project skeleton** for the course **IDS706 - Data Engineering Systems**.  
It was created by **Franco Amigo, PhD student in Population Health Sciences at Duke University**.

It demonstrates best practices for professional software development, including code organization, testing, automation, and continuous integration.

## Project Description
The project provides two example functions in `hello.py`:
- `say_hello(name: str) -> str`: Returns a personalized greeting message.
- `add(a: int, b: int) -> int`: Returns the sum of two integers.

Unit tests for these functions are defined in `test_hello.py`.
## Notes

For this initial assignment, the functions included in `hello.py` (`say_hello` and `add`) are the same as those provided in the course template.  
Future versions of this project will adapt and extend the functions once a specific project definition is established during the course.

## Setup Instructions
Clone the repository and open it in GitHub Codespaces or locally with Python 3.11.
